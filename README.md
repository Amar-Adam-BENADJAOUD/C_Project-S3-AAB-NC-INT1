# C_Project-S3-AAB-NC-INT1
Here is our C project
Two functions are at your disposition in main.c : part_1_2() and menu().
To see our work on part 1 and 2 you just have to execute the function part_1_2().
However for the part 3, you will have to look at the content of the agenda.c and agenda.h files and run the function menu.

Have a nice time on our project.

Cordially,
